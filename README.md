# UART
UART from zero to infinity using verilog

The designed UART has parity bit for verification of the transmitted data. It has 5 bit data, in an 8 bit long input binary string and one start, one stop and one parity bit in the string.

Currently it's in its very basic stage of development. Lets make it an industry grade UART with all the modern features that it should have.
